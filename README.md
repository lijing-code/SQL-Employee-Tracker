  ## Description
  This is a project about build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee databasem using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS).The application of Employee-Tracker will let the user (like a business owner) be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in his/her compnay, so that the user can organize and plan their own business employee system.
